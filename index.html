                    Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg and Cheese Croissant Sandwich.The sky high sodium and saturated fat contents make this pick a not go.It has 10 grams of saturated fat that's about 50 percent of your daily value and 610 milligrams of sodium

                <h2> COLD MEAT </h2>
                
                <p>There are few things better than a summer dinner party and few things worse than cooking for one.Sweating over a red-hot grill in August heat as your guests get steadily drunker and hungrier makes for a truly unpleasant hosting experience.

                    <p>
                    This soup uses a whole butternut squash, but if you donâ€™t like chopping up squashes, the supermarkets do packs of ready chopped squash in the freezer department, making this a handy standby meal.
